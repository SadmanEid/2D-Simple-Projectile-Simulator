# Simple-Trajectory-Simulator-
To calculate flight trajectory of simple objects. For now this project was built for 2D objects with very small negligible mass. Things to eventually add in the future-
<br> Affects of mass and its loss , Drag , Geometry of the launch , Thrust forces . (Maybe the atmosphere and weather effects)
